 Product Store One.
 
Product Store Simulation app
•	Windows forms app UI
•	Link to MS SQL DB
•	"code first" approach.

As a Store administrator I want to
•	add new products
•	check transactions
•	check/modify store balance
•	resupply warehouse
•	modify product prices
•	read product reviews
•	use automated processes
So that maximal profit can be obtained with lower costs.

As a Store client want to
•	find products easily
•	buy products
•	read/write product reviews
So that I do not lose too much time searching for the products I need.
